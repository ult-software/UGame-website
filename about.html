	<p>UGame is a Windows desktop application designed for users to keep a private library of games owned across platforms, that also allows the user to have lots of control over how they want their library to look, track their time in all of the games they own, and more.</p>
	<br>
	<p>UGame started development in January 2019, code-named simply, "The Library of Yeep", as a personal project for Merrek DeBolt. It was initially nothing more than a website that didn't do anything but show a table of information. After accomplishing this simple feat, Merrek DeBolt kept adding onto the project, eventually turning it into what it is today.</p>
